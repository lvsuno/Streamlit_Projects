# Streamlit_Projects
This is a multi-pages Streamlit application. The first one contains sentiment analysis of some sampled Twitter data. The tweets has been published in several language between February 24 2022 and February 25 2022. I kept only the geo-tagged rows (Find the middle coordinates when only a bounding boxes is available).

Some preprocessing are also made to identify the language when it's not available and to find the country from where the tweets have been published.

Several data displays have been made.
